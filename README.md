# Code Platoon Alumni Discord Bot

A community-maintained Discord bot for the Code Platoon Alumni server. The bot focuses on:

- **Event announcements** (automatic reminders at creation, 1 week before, 12 hours before, and at start)
- **Monthly event rundown** (post on the 1st of each month with all events and times)
- **Name policy audit** (DM users with rename instructions and a grace-period countdown; auto-kick when grace expires — stateless using join date)

> **Status:** Pre-code planning phase. This repo contains documentation, issues, and contribution guidelines to coordinate work before implementation.

## ✨ MVP Scope

### 1) Event Announcements
- Detect **Discord Scheduled Events** create/update/delete.
- Post reminders in a configured channel:
  - At event creation (instant summary)
  - **1 week before** start
  - **12 hours before** start
  - **At event start**

### 2) Monthly Event Rundown
- On the **1st of each month**, post a list of all scheduled events for the month in a configured channel.

### 3) Name Check + DM & Auto-Boot (No Database)
- Run daily or weekly based on config.
- For each non-compliant member:
  - Calculate days since `joinedAt`.
  - If days ≥ grace period (7 days daily / 30 days weekly) → kick and log.
  - Else → DM with policy and remaining days.

## 🧩 Slash Commands (planned)
- `/audit run` — run name audit manually
- `/privacy` — show privacy policy link
